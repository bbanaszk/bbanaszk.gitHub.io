## Chess

I love playing chess on my freetime and for this project I wanted to create my own Chess game with a custom GUI. This game includes all check, checkmate, and stalemate logic. Another
feature I implemented is that captured pieces show on either side of the board, the legal moves get displayed for whichever piece is currently selected, logic to undo a move all the 
way to beginning of the game, valid chess notation and a red glow behind opposing players pieces for any valid captures.

This project is not complete as I have been working on learning swift to fully reimplement that game and the GUI in an IOS App environment where more functionality will be added.
