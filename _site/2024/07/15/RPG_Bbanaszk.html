<p>In this project, I built a simple RPG game using Java to better understand design patterns. I implemented 3 design patterns that all work together to stimulate an RPG game where a player is
walking through a dungeon and encounters enemies that he fights, he can pickup loot dropped by the enemies and has a chance to come across a chest of items or a shop where items can
be purchased.</p>

<p>The 3 design patterns chosen were the Factory, Decorator, and the Strategy design patterns. The Factory design pattern is responsible for creating the player and enemy characters.
The Decorator design pattern is responsible for modifying the attributes, maintaining inventory, and upgrading the player character when the player wants to level up. This design
pattern is also responsible for leveling up the enemy characters so that the game gets progressively harder. 
The Strategy design pattern is responsible for the various combat attack and defense algorithms that both player and enemy characters can use.</p>

<p>Please see the README.md within the repository in the link below to see a more detailed description of the program.</p>
